            <h3>The Mario Amino Backup Project - a.k.a. AminoExporter</h3>
            <p>Any web service must come to an end some day - be it in a week or in a decade. With the popularity of the Amino social network slowly decreasing, an idea came to my mind.</p>
            <p>Let's archive and preserve our content in this app, for when the developers shut Amino down, we'll have a backup!</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I'm in the process of writing an easily usable and shareable program. It'll be hosted in my website soon.</p>
            <p>If you're a fellow Amino user, I hope you are fine with this. This project is still in early development.</p>
